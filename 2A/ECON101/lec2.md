### Marginal Analysis as a Solution to the Optimizaiton Principle

How do we use "behavior is optimization" assumption to predict behavior? We need somehow to be able to make these predictions.
- we need to start with the simplest possible decision: buying something or not buying something, or buying something else

#### What is a good?
It is a (physical) commodity, object; in contrast with a service

How can this model be simply displayed through an example. Our task is to predict how many soda cans Joe will buy in a store. What kind of model should we use for that?
- How do people behave in a store? How do you behave in a store?
- We can quantify the "willingness" to pay for the soda cans. How likely is it that Joe is going to buy one soda.
- Suppose that there is only 1 place to buy sodas. If price is $5, they are willing. "Willingness" is the maximum amount that you will pay. You will pay **UP TO** this amount.
- Continue asking increasing numbers, 1 can, 2 cans etc... This is called a "Willing to pay schedule".
- *HOWEVER*, you must assume the test subject is telling the truth. People will always have bias that will incentivize them to lie.
- Also called TWP; can be graphed for absolutely no benefit

#### How do we learn about behaviour?
Usually, we can infer people's tastes through their decisions. Jargon for this is *Revealed Preference*. 

Assume that the buyer will optimize for "Total Benefit - Total Cost" for all possible quantities.
- Can make a table out of the benefit-cost versus quantity

Marginal willingness is the willingness to pay for additional quantity.
